 Glow Essence — project snapshot

This README was created automatically as a safe, non-invasive change.
It contains the current state and quick manual test steps.

Files backed up in `backups/`:
- index.html.bak
- style.css.bak
- script.js.bak

Quick manual tests
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Add a product to the cart and verify the cart badge and mini-cart update.
- Click "Proceed to Checkout" and confirm items/total appear in the checkout modal.
- Complete an order using the checkout form — cart should clear and show the empty message briefly.
- Toggle dark mode using the moon/sun button.
- Use the search box to filter products.

Notes
- All edits made so far were designed to be additive and to avoid breaking existing behavior.
- If you want further changes (FAQ, improved footer, trust badges, accessibility audits), reply which items to implement next.
